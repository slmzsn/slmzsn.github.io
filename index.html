        <p> It's game time, folks. With the Super Bowl less than a week away, we're on the prowl for healthier versions of our favorite game day foods to serve at our viewing party. The current plan? To wow our guests with this healthier Buffalo chicken dip.<br><br>

This recipe uses Greek yogurt and reduced-fat cream cheese to get the creamy texture and real blue cheese for the authentic Buffalo flavor. The whole thing comes together in about 30 minutes and goes great with chips or veggies. (Then again, everything goes well with chips and veggies.)

        <p>If you've ever wandered into your gym's weight sectionâ€”congrats! You're well on your way to building strong bones, boosting your metabolism, and staving off disease. Regardless of how long you've been lifting, the one thing you can't miss among the machines and barbells and weight plates (oh my) is the overload of weight-lifting gear.<br><br>

But is there really any benefit to wearing all that armor while you deadlift? We asked a handful of experts to break down the benefits of the most common weight-lifting accessories, when to use (or not use) them, plus what to keep in mind before forking over the dough.</p>
